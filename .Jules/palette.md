## 2024-05-22 - Accessibility of Repetitive Actions
**Learning:** In list-based interfaces (like meal trackers), buttons with identical text (e.g., "Done") are confusing for screen reader users because they lack context.
**Action:** Always add unique `aria-label` attributes (e.g., "Mark Breakfast as done") to repetitive action buttons to provide context without changing the visual design.
